Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning
Author: Umair Zia
Description:
This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques to analyze network traffic data and identify potential intrusions. The system's development involves several key steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: The KDD Cup 1999 dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for intrusion detection, is loaded for training and testing purposes. We explore the dataset to understand its structure and content, ensuring its suitability for machine learning analysis.

Data Preprocessing: Before training machine learning models, we preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features and labels, and standardizing the features to ensure uniformity and compatibility across different algorithms.

Model Training and Evaluation: We train multiple machine learning models on the preprocessed data to classify network traffic as normal or malicious. Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors are implemented and evaluated. The performance of each model is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Comparison and Selection: After evaluating the models, we compare their performance to determine the most effective approach for intrusion detection. The model with the highest accuracy and robustness in detecting intrusions is selected for deployment in real-world scenarios.

Results:
The project results in the development of an effective Intrusion Detection System capable of accurately identifying potential intrusions in network traffic data. Through rigorous evaluation and comparison of multiple machine learning models, we identify the Random Forest model as the most suitable approach for intrusion detection in this scenario, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.83%. This high accuracy underscores the system's reliability and potential utility in enhancing network security and protecting against cyber threats.
